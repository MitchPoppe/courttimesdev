            <br>a.) If both coaches/teams show up to the same gym at the same time and have both reserved the same time, both coaches may agree to share the gym space for the reservation and will both be reimbursed for a full refund.
            <br>b.) If both coaches come to an agreement, one team may keep the reservation while the other receives a free booking of equal or lesser value in the future.
            <br>
            <br>Gym Unavailable: If you show up to your reserved gym and the gym is not open, the court is not available, etc., you will be granted a full refund and receive a free booking of equal or lesser value in the future.
            <br>
            <br>Transfer Reservation: If you want to transfer your reservation to another coach, please email us within 24 hours of the reservation at courttimes@mail.com with the following information:
